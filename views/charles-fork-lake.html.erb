  <p>Charles Fork Lake in Roane County, West Virginia, approximately 2 miles southeast of Spencer, accessible from WV Route 36 via County Route 36/2, is owned by the City of Spencer and provides our residents and guests alike with a multi-use area with over 25 miles of trails surrounding a mile long lake that sports excellent fishing, canoeing, and hiking and bike trails.&nbsp; Campsites are available.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Charles Fork   Lake is the site of the popular Tour de Lake Mountain Bike Race held annually. </p>
  <p>This lake was built in 1974 with maximum depth of 62 feet and an average depth of 27 feet. A concrete boat ramp is available and a trail surrounding most of the lake provides bank fishing access.</p>
  <p> Charles Fork Lake provides warmwater fishing for largemouth bass, sunfish, channel catfish, and tiger musky. Tiger musky generally obtain the 28‚Äù minimum size within 3-4 years and are considered one of the premier freshwater game fish by many sportsmen. Tackle used by musky fishermen includes large plugs, spoons, and spinners. Trolling the lake shoreline at depths between 3-12 feet is a successful musky fishing method. </p>
